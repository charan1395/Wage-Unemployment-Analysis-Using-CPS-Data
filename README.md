**Wage & Unemployment Analysis Using CPS Data (2017‚Äì2024)**

----
This project explores labor market dynamics in the United States by analyzing the Current Population Survey (CPS) data from January 2017 to December 2024. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, we examined wage inequality, gender pay gaps, industry-wise wage trends, and the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. The findings provide actionable insights for policy makers, HR teams, and economists.

üß† Key Objectives
Understand how education, industry, and gender impact wages.

Investigate gender wage disparities across industries and occupations.

Identify factors driving wage variability using machine learning.

Quantify the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment using causal inference.

üîç Methodology & Techniques
**Task**	                                                                 **Techniques Used**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing                                          	Filtering complete interviews, age & education bucketing, income normalization
Hypothesis Testing	                                                    T-tests, ANOVA to validate wage differences
Clustering	                                                            K-Means to segment individuals by industry, experience, occupation
Regression Modeling	                                                    Random Forest Regressor to determine wage predictors
Feature Importance	                                                    Feature Ablation to understand variable influence excluding interaction effects
Causal Inference	                                                      CausalImpact to isolate COVID‚Äôs impact on unemployment

üìà Key Insights
Education drives higher wages: Statistically significant wage differences were found across education levels.

Gender pay gap persists: Men consistently earn more than women across all industries and occupations, even after clustering.

Top wage influencers: Experience, education, occupation, and industry were most predictive of income levels.

COVID-19 Impact: A 2% increase in unemployment was directly attributed to the pandemic using causal inference.
